<!--  Button

This displays a clickable button and it’s mostly used in HTML forms to activate a script when clicked. 
<input type="button" value="Click me" onclick="msg()" />

Keep in mind you can also define buttons with the <button> tag, with the added benefit of being able 
to place content like text or images inside the tag. -->
<button onclick="alert('Are you sure you want to continue?')"> 
    <img src="https://yourserver.com/button_img.jpg" 
        alt="Submit the form" height="64" width="64">
</button> 


<!-- Checkbox

The form-handler is specified in the form’s "action" attribute: -->
<form action="myserver.com" method="POST">
    <!-- ... -->
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>


<!-- Text

Defines a basic single-line text field that a user can enter text into.  -->
<label for="fname">First name:</label> 
<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"> 


<!-- Password

Defines a single-line text field whose value is obscured, suited for sensitive information like passwords. -->
<label for="pwd">Password:</label> 
<input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd"> 


<!-- Date

Displays a control for entering a date with no time (year, month and day). -->
<label for="dob">Date of birth:</label>
<input type="date" id="dob" name="date of birth">


<!-- Datetime-local

as well as the time in hours and minutes. -->
<label for="birthdaytime">Birthday (date and time):</label>
<input type="datetime-local" id="birthdaytime" name="birthdaytime">


<!-- Email

Defines a field for an email address. It’s similar to a plain text input, 
with the addition that it validates automatically when submitted to the server. -->
<label for="email">Enter your email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email">


<!-- File

Displays a control that lets the user select and upload a file from their computer. 
To define the types of files permissible you can use the "accept" attribute. Also, 
to enable multiple files to be selected, add the "multiple" attribute. -->
<label for="myfile">Select a file:</label>
<input type="file" id="myfile" name="myfile">


<!-- Hidden

Defines a control that is not displayed but whose value is still submitted to the server. -->
<input type="hidden" id="custId" name="custId" value="3487">


<!-- Image

Defines an image as a graphical submit button. You should use the “src” attribute to point 
to the location of your image file. -->

<!-- Number

Defines a control for entering a number. You can use attributes to specify restrictions, 
such as min and max values allowed, number intervals or a default value. -->
<input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="5">


<!-- Range

Displays a range widget for specifying a number between two values. The precise value, however, 
is not considered important. This is typically represented using a slider or dial control. 
To define the range of acceptable values, use the “min” and “max” properties. -->
<label for="volume">Volume:</label>
<input type="range" id="volume" name="volume" min="0" max="10">


<!-- Reset

Displays a button that resets the contents of the form to their default values. -->

      <h1>---------Cheat sheet: Interactive form elements----------</h1>


<!--   When filling in HTML forms, we expect users to abide by certain rules, like using numbers 
when asked to, or properly formatting a URL or an email when needed. However, humans are 
prone to errors and in some cases, they may overlook some of the data they input. That’s 
why it’s important to ensure the shape of the data we expect in each field is correct.
 HTML form validation is a set of attributes we can add to form inputs to perform automatic
validation on the user’s behalf. 
The most important attributes you’ll find yourself using for validation are the following.



--- Required

Denotes a mandatory input that the user can’t leave empty. It can be used with any input 
type, like password, radio, text and so on. -->

<input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" required> 



<!-- Maxlength 

Specifies the maximum length of a text input, in other words, the maximum number of characters 
that can be entered for a specific field. If provided, it will prevent the user from entering more characters than the limit.  -->

<input type="text" id="description" name="description" maxlength="50"> 



<!-- Minlength 

Specifies the minimum length of a text input. If set, the input will not accept fewer characters than 
those specified.  -->

<input type="password" id="password" name="password" minlength="8"> 



<!-- Min and max attributes 

Determine the minimum and maximum values allowed for an input field. They are usually applied to numerical
text inputs, range inputs or dates.  -->

<input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="10"> 

<input type="range" id="volume" name="volume" min="1" max="100"> 



<!-- Multiple 

Indicates that the user can enter more than one value in a single input field. This attribute can only be 
used for email and file input types.  -->

<input type="file" id="gallery" name="gallery" multiple> 



<!-- Pattern 

Defines a particular pattern that an input field value has to fulfill to be considered valid. This 
attribute expects a regular expression to specify the pattern. It works with text, date, search, URL, 
tel, email and password input types. For example, you can restrict phone numbers to be only from the UK. -->
 
<input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern=”^(?:0|\+?44)(?:\d\s?){9,10}$” >  -->










              <h1>--------------Glossary: HTML form elements---------------</h1>


<!-- <form>


The <form> element in HTML is an important and useful element. The following sheet provides an overview of the 
    <form> constituent elements and their common attributes with simple examples for quick reference.


    
--- <input> 

It is used to create interactive controls, for example, buttons and various types of text fields and so on, to 
accept input or data from the user. The key attribute of this element is type. Some common values for the type 
include: button, checkbox, date, email, number, password, submit, text, and url. These values dictate the 
appearance of the element. For example, this code:-->

<form action="my_action_page"> 

  <label for="uname">Username:</label> 
  <br> 
  <input type="text" id="uname" name="username"> 
  <br> 
  <label for="pwd">Password:</label> 
  <br> 
  <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd"> 
  <br><br> 
  <input type="submit" value="Login"> 
</form> 



<!-- <label>

Defines a label for an element. It has an attribute "for", the value of which should be equal to the id attribute of the 
element it is associated with. Note how in the example above, the <label> is associated with the <input> using its id value. 



--- <select>

Defines a drop-down list of options presented to the user. It has a couple of attributes: 

    - Form, the id of the form in which the drop-down appears 

    - Name specifies the name of the control 

    - Multiple Boolean attribute, when specified, indicates if a user can select multiple options out of the list 

    - Required indicates if the user is required to select an option before submitting a form 

    - Size mentions the number of visible options in a drop-down list 

The options in a drop-down list are defined using the <option> element inside <select>. Note the example in the <option> description below. 



---  <textarea>

Defines a multi-line input field, typically to allow the user to input longer textual data. The common attributes for this element include: 

  - cols defines the width of the text area, the default value is 20 

  - form the form element the text area is associated with 

  - maxlength when specified, limits the maximum number of characters that can be entered in the text area 

  - minlength the minimum number of characters that the user should enter 

  - readonly once set, the user cannot modify the contents 

  - rows defines the number of visible text lines for the text area 

The following line of code defines a text area of 10 visible lines and nearly 30 characters wide where the user can input a maximum of 200 characters:  -->

<textarea name="response" rows="10" cols="30" maxlength=”200”> </textarea> 



<!-- <button>

Defines a clickable button. The onclick attribute defines the behavior when the button is clicked by the user. 
For example, in the code below, an alert message is shown to the user. -->

 <button type="button" onclick="alert('You just clicked!')">Click Me! 
</button> 



<!-- <fieldset> 

Used to group related input elements in a form. For instance, elements related to the user’s personal information 
and educational qualification can be grouped separately in two field sets. 



--- <legend> 

Defines a caption for the <fieldset> element. For example: --> 

 <fieldset> 
    <legend>Personal Info</legend> 
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br> 
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br> 
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br> 
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br> 
  </fieldset> 
  
  <fieldset> 
    <legend>Qualificaiton</legend> 
    <label for="pdegree">Primary degree:</label><br> 
    <input type="text" id="pdegree" name="degree" value="Masters"><br> 
    <label for="fos">Last name:</label><br> 
    <input type="text" id="fos" name="field" value="Psychology"><br> 
  </fieldset> 



  <!-- <datalist>

Specifies a list of pre-defined options for an input element. It differs from <select> since the user 
can still provide textual or numeric input other than the listed options. -->

<form action="/my_action_page"> 
    <label for="flowers">Favourite flower:</label><br> 
    <input list="flowers" name="flowers"> 
    <datalist id="flowers"> 
      <option value="Rose"> 
      <option value="Lily"> 
      <option value="Tulip"> 
      <option value="Daffodil"> 
      <option value="Orchid"> 
    </datalist> 
    ... 
</form>



<!-- <output> 

Represents the result of a calculation (typically the output of a script) or the outcome of the user action.



--- <option> 

Defines an option for the drop-down list. The following code example demonstrates how a simple
list can be defined, with the rendered view below the code block.  -->

<label for="course">Choose a course:</label><br> 
<select id="course" name="courselist"> 
  <option value="html">HTML Introduction</option> 
  <option value="css">Styling with CSS</option> 
  <option value="js">JavaScript</option> 
  <option value="react" selected>React Basics</option> 
</select> 

<!-- By default, the first item in the drop-down list is selected. To define a pre-selected option, 
add the selected attribute to the option. 



--- <optgroup> 

Defines a group of related options in a drop-down list. Its attribute label names the group. -->
